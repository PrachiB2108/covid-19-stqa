  ['Can vaccinated people still get COVID-19?', 'Yes, infection is still possible. Vaccination is mainly aimed at reducing the risk of severe illness.'],
  ['Are there side effects?', 'Mild, short-lived effects such as a sore arm, tiredness or low fever are common. Serious reactions are rare. Talk to a health professional about your own situation.'],
